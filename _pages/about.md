<!-- * I received my Bachelor’s Degree at [Southwest Jiao Tong University](http://www.swjtu.edu.cn/) at June 2019. I am now pursuing my Ph.D. degree in [Apex Lab.](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net/) and [Prof. Yong Yu](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu). I used to be the group leader of [ApexRL](https://github.com/apexrl), the RL research group of Apex Lab. I am also a member of [Wu Wen Jun Honorary Doctoral Plan (吴文俊荣誉博士班)](https://xsb.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/xsb/info/33498.htm), advised by [Prof. Cewu Lu](https://www.mvig.org/). I won [ByteDance Scholars Program (字节跳动奖学金)](https://ur.bytedance.com/scholarship) (10 candidates worldwide each year) in 2022.
